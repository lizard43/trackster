        <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>

        <h3>1. Information about our use of cookies</h3>

        <p>Our website uses cookies to save your team selections and to distinguish you from other users of our
            website.
            This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to
            improve our site.</p>

        <p>Due to legal requirements, all websites that operate across certain parts of the European Union are required
            to obtain
            consent to using or storing cookies (or similar technologies) on your computers or mobile device. This
            cookie policy
            (hereinafter the “Policy”) provides you with clear and relevant information about the cookies we use and
            the purposes for using those cookies.</p>

        <p> </p>

        <h3>2. Your Consent</h3>

        <p>By continuing to use our website, you are agreeing to our placing cookies on your computer in order to
            analyse the way you use our website.
            Please read the Policy carefully for more details about the information we collect when you use this site.</p>

        <p><b>If you do not wish to accept cookies in connection with your use of this website, you must stop using our
                site.</b></p>

        <p> </p>

        <h3>3. What is a cookie?</h3>

        <p>A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that are placed on your browser or the hard drive of your
            computer.
            Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive.</p>

        <p> </p>

        <h3>4. Key Concepts</h3>

        <p>First and third-party cookies: whether a cookie is ‘first’ or ‘third’ party refers to the domain placing the
            cookie.</p>

        <p>First-party cookies: are those set by a website that is being visited by the user at the time.</p>

        <p>Third-party cookies: are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being visited by
            the user.
            If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website this would be a
            third-party cookie.</p>

        <p>Persistent cookies: these cookies remain on a user’s device for the period of time specified in the cookie.
            They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.</p>

        <p>Session cookies: these cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser
            session.
            A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser
            window.
            Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.</p>

        <p> </p>

        <h3>5. Can I withdraw my consent?</h3>

        <p>Once you have given us your consent to the use of cookies, we shall store a cookie on your computer or
            device to remember this for next time.</p>

        <p>This will expire periodically. If you wish to withdraw your consent at any time, you will need to delete
            your cookies by using your internet browser settings.</p>

        <p> </p>

        <h3>6. What personal information do cookies collect?</h3>

        <p>Generally, a cookie will contain a string of text that contains information about the browser. To work, a
            cookie does not need to know where you are from, it only needs to remember your browser.</p>

        <p>However, there are some cookies we use which may store more personal information about you. This can be done
            only if you yourself have provided our website with that personal information.</p>

        <p> </p>
